# TetrisChafa
Totally inspired by one of my favorite games, Tetris, this is my first project of this type, it is little, but I put a lot of effort into it and
I want to share it with the game developer community.

## Game Controls

    * Right and left: lateral movements.
    * Down: fast fall.
    * Up: hold current piece.
* Z: counterclockwise rotation.
